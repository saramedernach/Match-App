# Match-App
Match App simulates a card game in which a set of cards are placed face down.  Each turn the player selects two cards to be flipped over.  If the chosen cards are matching pairs, the cards will disappear.  If not, they will flip back over and the player must try again.  The object of the game is to turn over every pair of matching cards before the timer runs out.
